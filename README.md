# Bug Checklist

List of common issues to check before pulling your hair out

# CLI, NPM, Running Programs

1. Has an interferring folder been created, interupting cli scripts?

- E.g. duplicate @app folder being created, NextJS running that folder first

2. Is there a global installation causing problems?

- E.g. Node 18.4.0 being installed in user directory, being used over NVM 21.5.0

1. Are you refreshing the right page/file/folder?
